# Icon
Icons are used as a visual indicator to describe an action the user could take. That little Facebook icon never looked better.

### Usage
Imports:
```js
import { Icon } from 'galio-framework';
```

Simple example:
```jsx
<Icon name="pin-3" family="Galio" color={rgb(100,120,40)} size={10} />
```
